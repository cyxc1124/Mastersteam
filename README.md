A lightweight and efficient web API for querying game servers from the Steam server list. Built with Go, providing RESTful JSON endpoints.

## ‚ú® Features

- üî• **Steam Web API Integration** - Uses official Steam Web API for reliable server queries
- ‚ö° **High Performance** - Concurrent processing with configurable worker pools
- üéÆ **Universal Support** - Works with all Steam games that have dedicated servers
- üìä **Rich JSON API** - RESTful endpoints with comprehensive server information
- üê≥ **Docker Ready** - Pre-built multi-architecture Docker images
- üåç **Cross-Platform** - Binaries available for Windows, Linux, and macOS
- üîç **Flexible Filtering** - Search by AppID, server name, or IP address
- üìà **Player Information** - Get detailed player stats and online player lists

## üìã Requirements

- **Steam Web API Key** (Required) - Get yours at [steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
- Go 1.24+ (for building from source)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

> **Note:** The legacy UDP Master Server (`hl2master.steampowered.com:27011`) is deprecated and no longer reliable. This version requires a Steam Web API key.
